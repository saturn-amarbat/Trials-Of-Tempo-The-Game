## Game Title

**Trials of Tempo**

## Game Concept

A rhythm-based platformer with jetpack gameplay where the player controls a character that moves forward automatically through a world of music-driven obstacles. Each movement, jump, and dodge is timed to the beat of the soundtrack.

## Genre

Rhythm-Action / Platformer

## Core Mechanics

- Dodge obstacles in sync with the beat of the song.
- Use jetpack or powerups (Shield, Speed Boost) to survive rhythm-based challenges.
- Timing and reaction are key to progressing through levels.

## Player Mode

Single Player

## Narrative

You play as a small test subject placed inside experimental “Tempo Chambers,” where each stage is synchronized to a different song. Your mission: survive the Trials of Tempo and prove that rhythm and precision can overcome chaos.

## Technical Specs

### Controls

- Spacebar → Activate Powerup (Shield / Speed)

### View

### Objective

Avoid obstacles, stay on-beat, and reach the end of each chamber without failing.

### UI Design

- Minimalist neon interface (RGB aesthetic).
- Rhythm-synced visual cues and effects.

## Gameplay Flow

When you start The Trials of Tempo, you find yourself inside a glowing chamber where every surface moves to the beat. Your character launches forward automatically, the sound of each drum kick syncing with bursts of light and motion. As synth waves rise, platforms lift, lasers flash, and the floor pulses beneath your feet. You must time your jumps, dashes, and shields perfectly to match the rhythm. A mistimed move sends your avatar crashing into a glowing barrier, resetting your momentum. Each song brings new visual themes—a storm of violet energy, shifting geometric walls, or rippling waves of sound—and the challenge grows more intense as you near the end. When you finally reach the boss chamber, the screen vibrates with color and rhythm, demanding flawless timing to survive the ultimate test of tempo.
